# Example app

The source code for the example app.

After cloning, run the following command inside this directory:

```
flutter create .
```

For running on macOS, you will need to allow outgoing network connections for the sample images to load. For that, open `macos/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode, click on the `Runner` target, activate the `Signing & Capabilities` tab and check the `Outgoing Connections (Client)` checkbox under `App Sandbox (Debug and Profile)`.
